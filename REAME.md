# Brown paper packages

Open the project ‘BrownPaperPackages’ and view the class 'WrappedUp'.

You should complete the guessMyFavourite () method.

This method should create a string object with your favourite thing in it e.g the String object could be called favouriteAnimal and have the contents “cow”, “dog” “cat” or “car”, or anything you like.

Using Scanner you should prompt for a guess. e,g. for cow.‘Guess my favourite animal. It has 3 characters and begins with c’. (To get the length 3 – for a cow and the first letter c, you should use String methods).
You should then test the guess to see if it equals your favourite thing – ignore case. An appropriate message should be displayed.
